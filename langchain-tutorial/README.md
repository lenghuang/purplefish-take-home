# Lang Chain Tutorial

I asked an LLM about if it's better to do something with either OpenAI Agents SDK, or LangChain. The pros and cons seem to be that LangChain is better for more "legit" apps, and has less vendor lock. I think I could get a more effective demo with OpenAI Agents SDK, but think for personal learning LangChain may be better. So I'm gonna actively make that tradeoff.

To get my self caught up to speed, I'm using this folder to go through this tutorial.
